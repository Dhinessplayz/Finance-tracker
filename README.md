# Finance-tracker
This is a app that will store and track finances. This includes Transactions, setting and viewing budgets and savings goals
(Everything is in the Finance Tracker File to keep everything together)

Full Disclosure

This is a simple app made 100% out of python (except for the finance.db file) that tracks your finances
It seems pretty simple but it has a lot of functionality and utils to work with.
You can add transactions you've made to the database, view the transactions you have made
You can set budgets and view the budgets you have set
You can Set savings goal and check the progress of it

What sets this app apart from others is its rather simplicity and the ability to visualise your spending.
What this means is that after you have entered some transactions (spendings) the app (or the visualization.py file in particular)
will allow you to literally visualize your spendings in the form of a pie chart. 
The pie chart created will only be accurate based on how (logical) the transactions (spendings) you have entered into the app's datatbase.
The fun part is that all of this is saved [And can be deleted using Option 8] so you can keep adding on transactions (spendings) and the
pie chart will adjust or change according to the new data that has been entered.

The expectations and the things that are yet to be added to this app is high. The development will be quite slow as I have used everything
at my disposal (knowledge) to program what I currently have here [everything described above] and further development means I have to do more
research and learning wich rather takes time as I have to completely understand what I am doing in order to improve on it in further versions
Soon there will be a complete GUI for this app as the current GUI (gui.py) that we have basically does nothing and has no practical use
so I am planning on improving on that and providing a full GUI for the app to make it more 'App like' and 'user-friendly'
